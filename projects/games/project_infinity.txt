the game most likely is going to be an RPG and have puzzles
  
code name dome world


Based on of Under the Dome series 
ancient world 
2 world merge and for the dome ??????
the only way to separate then is to find all the missing pieces of the armor  no one now if the armor would even work?????
mix the world of Under the Dome and sort art only????????

line Throughout heaven and earth, I alone am The Honored One”

the step ///THE EMINENCE IN SHADOW
make the character complealy dissaper form the world( just errases the present of the character and moves it to another location ) and teleports the charancter shome where(not teleportation the character is so fast that it looks like it teleperting )

make a character that can push objects away  to attract them  and  objects slow down if they are about to hit the character and combine push and pull to make an ability

object slow down near contact passive(armor?????)
push, pull activation ability

push pull ult 

think    pain, Gojo, or even a Jedi powers 

class Abilitys{
  abilitys{
          pasive{ slow down near contact }
          onActivation{
              push, pull
          }
          ultimate{
            pull push(code name black hole)
          }
        
  }
}


class Armor{
  head????
  body
  hand/arms
  legs
  
}






if it is Armor   

some cooldown must happen for balance 
character can learn to master one ability over the others if they want however it will decrease the use cases of the others


make the different parts of the armor have different ability  

head => give the ability to control the direction of push and pull ()

hands => push-pull  (you can have an ability that allows you to push the ground and that makes you jump high but, the character will receive damage/stun) (with the pull character will be able to pull itself to the ground or the enemy  however a drawback must happen for balance )

body passive slow down


legs super jump no damage/stun on landing   (leap(in the air like sanji????) to enemy/dash to place )





have a system that shows how evil/good(not good or evil just  a scale) the character is  and the character is able to use different abilities loot depending on that
