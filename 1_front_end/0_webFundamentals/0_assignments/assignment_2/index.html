		<h2>About</h2>

		<!-- paragraph -->
		<p>
			Master Chief is the protagonist in the Halo series of video games
			and related media. Also known as Master Chief Petty Officer
			John-117, the character first appeared in the 2001 video game Halo:
			Combat Evolved, a military science fiction first-person shooter that
			became a long-running game series. The character also appears in
			spin-off Halo media such as the 2012 film Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn,
			the 2022 Halo television series, and several graphic novels and
			books.

		<p>
			The Master Chief is a towering supersoldier known as a "Spartan",
			trained from childhood for combat. The designers intended for
			players to be able to project their own intentions into the
			character, and thus reduced his voiced lines and concealed his
			appearance under his armor. In the video games, the character is
			voiced by former disc jockey Steve Downes, who based his performance
			on Bungie's description calling for a man of few words, similar to
			Clint Eastwood. In spin-off media, he is portrayed by different
			voice and physical actors, most notably Pablo Schreiber in the 2022
			live-action Halo TV series. The Master Chief has been seen as a
			mascot for Halo and the Xbox brand. The character has received a
			generally positive reception for his character design. While
			publications have praised how the narrative allows players to
			inhabit the character, others have criticized him as under
			characterized.
